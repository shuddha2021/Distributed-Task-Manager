# Distributed Task Scheduler

Welcome to the Distributed Task Scheduler project! This is a simplified implementation of a Distributed Task Scheduler and Executor, showcasing my skills in full-stack development and distributed computing concepts.

## Overview

This project provides a basic frontend interface for users to submit tasks and monitor their execution status in real-time. Behind the scenes, the backend logic efficiently schedules and executes tasks, demonstrating my proficiency in building scalable and reliable systems.

## Features

- **Task Submission**: Users can submit tasks through a user-friendly interface.
- **Real-time Status**: Task status updates are displayed in real-time for seamless monitoring.
- **Efficient Scheduling**: Tasks are scheduled and executed efficiently to ensure optimal performance.
- **Simple Interface**: The frontend interface is designed for ease of use and intuitive task management.
